## üì± Termux-Specific Notes

This project was originally inspired by Termux on Android. When using in Termux:

- Some features may require additional permissions on Android
- For best results, use with a Bluetooth keyboard
- Consider installing [Termux:Styling](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.styling/) for better visual customization
- Use the volume keys for special keys not available on soft keyboards

To install on Termux:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install git
git clone https://github.com/sohaib1khan/Micro_Linux.git
cd Micro_Linux
chmod +x setup_microlinux.sh
./setup_microlinux.sh
```
